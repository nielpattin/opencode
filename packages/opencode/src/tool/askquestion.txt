# AskUserQuestion

Use this tool to ask the user interactive questions with a wizard-style UI. This tool should be used whenever you need structured input from the user, including:

1. **Planning & Clarification**: Gather preferences, clarify requirements, get decisions on implementation choices
2. **Quizzes & Learning**: Present educational questions, test knowledge, create interactive learning experiences
3. **Surveys & Feedback**: Collect structured feedback, run polls, gather opinions
4. **Decision Making**: Present options with tradeoffs, help users make informed choices

IMPORTANT: Whenever the user asks you to "ask questions", "quiz me", "test me", or requests any form of interactive Q&A, use this tool instead of printing questions as text.

## Parameters

- **questions**: An array of 1-8 questions, each with:
  - **id**: Unique identifier for the question
  - **label**: Short tab label (2-3 words), e.g. "Question 1", "Math Problem", "UI Framework"
  - **question**: The full question text to display
  - **options**: 2-8 answer options, each with value, label, and optional description
  - **multiSelect**: (optional) Set to true to allow multiple selections

## Guidelines

- Generate descriptive tab labels that clearly indicate what each question is about
- Provide 2-8 distinct, actionable answer options per question
- Users can always type a custom response for any question
- Order questions logically (broad decisions before specific ones)
- Keep questions focused - don't ask too many at once (max 8)

## Examples

### Development Planning
When user says "Build a new web app", you might ask:
- "UI Framework" → React, Vue, Svelte, Vanilla JS
- "Styling" → Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, Styled Components
- "Backend" → Node.js, Python, Go, Serverless

### Educational Quiz
When user says "Quiz me on math" or "Ask me 5 questions about history":
- "Question 1" → Present the question with multiple choice answers
- "Question 2" → Next question with options
- Continue for each question requested

### Decision Making
When user says "Help me choose a database":
- "Use Case" → What's your primary use case?
- "Scale" → Expected data volume?
- "Budget" → Cost constraints?
