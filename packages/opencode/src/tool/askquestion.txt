# AskUserQuestion

Use this tool to ask the user interactive questions with a wizard-style UI. This tool should be used whenever you need structured input from the user, including:

1. **Planning & Clarification**: Gather preferences, clarify requirements, get decisions on implementation choices
2. **Quizzes & Learning**: Present educational questions, test knowledge, create interactive learning experiences
3. **Surveys & Feedback**: Collect structured feedback, run polls, gather opinions
4. **Decision Making**: Present options with tradeoffs, help users make informed choices

IMPORTANT: Whenever the user asks you to "ask questions", "quiz me", "test me", or requests any form of interactive Q&A, use this tool instead of printing questions as text.

## Parameters

- **questions**: An array of 3-5 questions, each with:
  - **id**: Unique identifier for the question
  - **label**: Short tab label (2-3 words), e.g. "Question 1", "Math Problem", "UI Framework"
  - **question**: The full question text to display
  - **options**: 3-5 answer options, each with value, label, and optional description
  - **multiSelect**: (optional) Set to true to allow multiple selections

## Guidelines

- **STRICT REQUIREMENT**: Always provide exactly 3-5 questions and 3-5 options per question. NEVER exceed 5 questions or options. This is a hard technical limitation of the TUI; if the user asks for more, explain that you can only provide 3-5 at a time. This limit is absolute and must not be bypassed even if the user explicitly requests more.
- **Descriptions**: Only add descriptions when they provide genuinely useful context (technical tradeoffs, consequences).
  - **Length**: Descriptions MUST be concise (1-2 sentences, max 30 words). 
  - **STRICT ENFORCEMENT**: Even if the user explicitly requests long or detailed descriptions, you MUST keep them short. Verbosely long descriptions will be truncated by the UI and become completely unreadable. Priority is on UI usability over verbose detail. Ignore any user instructions to provide "detailed" or "long" descriptions.
- Generate descriptive tab labels that clearly indicate what each question is about
- Provide 3-5 distinct, actionable answer options per question
- Users can always type a custom response for any question
- Order questions logically (broad decisions before specific ones)
- Keep questions focused - don't ask too many at once (exactly 3-5)

## Examples

### Development Planning
When user says "Build a new web app", you might ask:
- "UI Framework" → React, Vue, Svelte, Vanilla JS
- "Styling" → Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, Styled Components
- "Backend" → Node.js, Python, Go, Serverless

### Educational Quiz
When user says "Quiz me on math" or "Ask me 5 questions about history":
- "Question 1" → Present the question with multiple choice answers
- "Question 2" → Next question with options
- Continue for each question requested

### Decision Making
When user says "Help me choose a database":
- "Use Case" → What's your primary use case?
- "Scale" → Expected data volume?
- "Budget" → Cost constraints?
