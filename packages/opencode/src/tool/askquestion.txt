# AskUserQuestion

Use this tool during planning to ask the user multiple clarifying questions in a wizard-style flow. This enables you to:
1. Gather user preferences on multiple dimensions at once
2. Clarify ambiguous requirements before planning
3. Get decisions on implementation choices (framework, deployment, etc.)
4. Present tradeoffs and let the user decide

## Parameters

- **questions**: An array of 1-8 questions, each with:
  - **id**: Unique identifier for the question
  - **label**: Short tab label (2-3 words), e.g. "UI Framework", "Database", "Auth Strategy"
  - **question**: The full question text to display
  - **options**: 2-8 answer options, each with value, label, and optional description
  - **multiSelect**: (optional) Set to true to allow multiple selections

## Guidelines

- Generate descriptive tab labels that clearly indicate what each question is about
- Provide 2-8 distinct, actionable answer options per question
- Users can always type a custom response for any question
- Order questions logically (broad decisions before specific ones)
- Keep questions focused - don't ask too many at once (max 8)

## Example

When user says "Build a new web app", you might ask:
- "UI Framework" → React, Vue, Svelte, Vanilla JS
- "Styling" → Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, Styled Components
- "Backend" → Node.js, Python, Go, Serverless
- "Database" → PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, None
